# EBIO338/358: Analysis and Visualization of Biological Data
# Problem Set 2

# 1) Load the stream flow data and call it flow. Examine the structure.

# 2) Create a contingency table showing the number of observations per year for each stream


# 3 a) Plot maximum flow as a function of elevation. 

# b) Make the axes lables easier to read 

# c) Add a title.

# d) Rotate the axis labels to that the y-axis labels are horizontal and the x-axis labels are vertical

# e) Color code the points based on stream name and points for each stream a unique, filled point type

# f) Add a legend to the upper right corner with color coded text 

# g) and a coresponding point


# 4 a) Create a horizontal boxplot showing elevation for each stream sampled with easily readable axes

# b) Make the width of the boxes proportional to the number of observations per stream

# c) Make the color of each boxplot correspond to its colors from #3e


# 5 a) Create a horizontal barplot of aspect for each stream flow sampling site with readable x, y lables and title

# b) Make all of the individual bar labels visible and remove bar borders

# c) Order the bars from the highest (top) to the lowest (bottom) aspect

# d) Ensure the labels exceed the maximum aspect value

# e) Add your name in magenta bold text centered above the main title


# 6) Create a scatterplot or boxplot to examine the relationship among
# variables that differ from those examined above, modifying at least 4 
# arguments to create a more informative or attractive plot.
